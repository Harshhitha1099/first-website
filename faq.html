	<h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2>1.When will the hyperimmune be produced and ready for clinical trials? </h2>
    <p> Right now we're focused on collecting plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. We will produce the hyperimmune globulin and begin clinical testing as soon as possible</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>2.Will these donors be compensated like other donors?</h2>
    <p>Because plasma donation takes time - the first visit for a donation can take up to two hours and subsequent donations about an hour - donors are compensated because of this time and commitment involved in being a regular plasma donor. At all Grifols plasma donor centers commitment fees are put on a Grifols pre-paid debit card. </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>3.How much plasma will you collect from each donor? Can a recovered COVID-19 donor donate more than once? </h2>
    <p> Donors will donate between 660 to 880 milliliters of plasma based on their weight. Like normal source plasma donors, convalescent plasma donors are able to donate as frequently as twice in a seven-day period with a full day in-between donations</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>4.How will patients be screened? </h2>
    <p>All potential donors should call 1-866-END-CV19 where they will be prescreened by trained Grifols specialists who will verify that the interested donors have a diagnosis made with a test (nasal swab or blood) and complete resolution of COVID-19 symptoms at least 28 days prior to donation, or complete resolution of symptoms at least 14 days prior to donation along with a negative molecular test for COVID-19, as recommended by the FDA.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>5.Will you turn away donors once you reach a certain level of convalescent plasma?</h2>
    <p>During this exceptional time we do not anticipate turning away any donor who wants to make a difference and meets our criteria. </p>
