<h1>CONVALESCENT PLASMA DONATION</h1>
	<br>
	<hr>
<p>Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood that is collected from patientswho have recovered from the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused
by the virus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients develop antibodies in the blood
against the virus. Antibodies are proteins that might help fight the infection.
Convalescent plasma is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19
because there is no approved treatment for this disease and there is some
information that suggests it might help some patients recover from COVID-19.
</p>
<p>	People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 for at least two weeks are
encouraged to consider donating plasma, which may help save the lives of
other patients. COVID-19 convalescent plasma must only be collected from
recovered individuals if they are eligible to donate blood. Individuals must
have had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a laboratory test and
meet other donor criteria. Individuals must have complete resolution of
symptoms for at least 14 days prior to donation. A negative lab test for active
COVID-19 disease is not necessary to qualify for donation.</p>
